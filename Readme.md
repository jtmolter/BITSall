# Balloon Iridium Telemetry System

## DEPRECATED
Now part of https://github.com/UMDBPP/command_module


## Overview
This payload functions with an Iridium 9603 on a RockBlock carrier board. BITS has flown in various forms starting with NS-75 and continuously since NS-79 (10+ at this point) Iridium communications provide tracking from launch to landing, allowing for retrival of exact coordinates when landing in an area with no cell coverage. Additionally, the payload has been used as a long range link to then send data via XBee to other payloads.

Documentation is currently WIP (but for real this time)
